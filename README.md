<h1 align="center">Hello beings of the universe, 👽🖖</h1>

:shipit: **My open software & open science work:**
  - [NumFOCUS DISC](https://numfocus.org/programs/diversity-inclusion) steering committee member 2022 - 2024
  - [Jupyter distinguished contributor](https://jupyter.org/governance/distinguished_contributors.html)
  - [PyLadies Berlin](https://berlin.pyladies.com/) and [Women of Color Code](https://www.linkedin.com/company/84894279/) co-organizer 2020 - 2024
  - NASA's subject matter expert @[TOPS](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science) program

✨ **Coordination and cooperation research:**

I believe the most critical problem that we face today is the one of [coordination](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) and mindful cooperation for the flourishing of human kind, so I'm dedicating a big part of my time to work on it!

  - Curr. @[CHAI - UC Berkeley](https://www.https://humancompatible.ai/) & Jinesis Lab - UToronto
  - Prev. @[BarfussLab](https://wbarfuss.github.io/) - University of Bonn, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology

🌱 **Slowly cultivated interests:**
  - Extreme poverty reduction: I'm interested in ways of diminishing the inequality gap. I support causes like [Give Directly](https://www.givedirectly.org/), land redistribution coupled with permaculture and community building in rural contexts, global free internet access and leveraging non-traditional methods of pedagogy in regions of extreme poverty. I also wonder about applying cybernetics and machine learning techniques to help solve redistribution issues and find pareto optimal equilibria among economical actors.
  - Governance and open source: Increasing interoperability, [free access to knowledge](https://annas-archive.org/donate) and empowering democracy in a world of machines and humans. [Audrey Tang's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Tang) work is my biggest inspiration for what one can accomplish in this area. Though heroes like [Schwartz](https://ia600101.us.archive.org/1/items/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/Goamjuly2008.pdf) and [Elbakyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Elbakyan) taught me to dream of a more beautiful digital world much earlier on.
  - Living vicariously [through books](https://marimeireles.com/reading-list.html).
  - Noticing the wonder of every moment.

🦄 **Communicorn:**

*Community is my favorite thing in the universe! If you think we can have a serendipitous interaction, hit me up! I love to share with others. ✨*

  - I host dinners and salons in Berlin. Themes we talked about include "The limits of free speech", "Spirituality and rituals", "Rethinking future socio-economic structures and institutions", etc. If you are a Berliner or a passer-by and would like to join we welcome first-timers, just send me an email!
  - Check out the "community" session on my website!

🧠 **Want to hire my beautiful brains?:**

I'm open to techinical AI Safety positions in the Bay Area! Feel free to send me an email and/or grab a time on my [calendar](https://calendar.app.google/BocgEAFEH9JD8YKN9) to discuss.

And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love." - Corinthians 13_
