<h1 align="center">Hello beings of the universe, 👽🖖</h1>

:shipit: **My open software & open science work:**
  - [NumFOCUS DISC](https://numfocus.org/programs/diversity-inclusion) steering committee member 2022 - 2024
  - [Jupyter distinguished contributor](https://jupyter.org/governance/distinguished_contributors.html)

  - NASA's subject matter expert @[TOPS](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science) program

✨ **Coordination and cooperation research:**

I believe the most critical problem that we face today is the one of [coordination](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/), so I'm dedicating a big part of my time to work on it!

  - Curr. @[CHAI - UC Berkeley](https://www.https://humancompatible.ai/)
  - Prev. @[BarfussLab](https://wbarfuss.github.io/), University of Bonn

🌱 **Slowly cultivated interests:**
  - Extreme poverty reduction: I'm interested in ways of diminishing the inequality gap, paying special attention to people living in extreme poverty. I think about [running tech intership projects](https://www.notion.so/marimeireles/Global-south-internship-program-6ba5ab15a0f54f2187a55ba0d01aab59?pvs=4) in the global south, implementing a fitting [ pedagogical ethos](https://www.notion.so/marimeireles/Pedagogical-ethos-for-kids-impacted-with-poverty-aacad2d96f3c422199524255878b2f07?pvs=4) for kids impacted with poverty, [teaching farmers about permaculture and supporting them with an NGO](https://www.notion.so/marimeireles/Familiar-permaculture-project-Brazil-0277fccccb7740c49cc0845b824e9d10?pvs=4) and [increasing internet access in the world](https://www.notion.so/marimeireles/Increasing-internet-access-b377c40a21ba483ebec686afc0a508c5?pvs=4).
  - [Governance and open source](https://www.notion.so/marimeireles/Governance-and-open-source-63235d5f677448cfb411db8dbed19fc4): Increasing interoperability and people's agency in a world of machines and humans. Currently, I'm interested in promoting digital democracy supporting work like [vodle](https://github.com/pik-gane/vodle#readme) or the Plurality Institute.
  - [Using books to live vicariously](http://marimeireles.com/books.html)
  - Noticing the wonder of each moment
